# Simple Python extractor

## How to run
Run the Python file from this directory.

Result will be dumped into the `output.json`, logs could be found in `simple_extractor.log`

## Why this tech stack?
I used Python because it is the fastest tool to build a simple solution.

## Pros
- Runs faster and in fewer steps if the execution is only needed once and with specified constant filters
- Doesn't require disk space

## Cons
- Code modification is necessary if different filters are needed
- Can't combine multiple JSON files

## How long it took me to make?
~1h researching
~1h building the solution

## How long does it run?
~50-55s (both extracting and filtering) using local resources
